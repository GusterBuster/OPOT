# OPOT
data files for comparing optimal transport algorithms

## Data format:
+ Line 1: n and m, the # of rows and columns respectively
+ Line 2: n numbers, demands (in integers) of the left side
+ Line 3: m numbers, demands (in integers) of the right side (total of line 2 equals total of line 3)
+ Line 4 - n + 3: m numbers per line, the costs of transporting something from i to j
